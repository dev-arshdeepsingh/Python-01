# Module is file of code written by someone, which can be reused by us


import pyjokes   #But before this type "pip import pyjokes" in terminal
                 #pip is used to install modules

# print("Printing Jokes...")

# This prints a random joke
joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
print(joke)


# so thanks

# another line
# Yet another line


# We can make our terminal a calculator , by typing python & pressing enter first, then we can perform various operations like + - * / print etc in PCs CMD itself

# Comments are used to make program readable for other programmers so that they can understand our code
# we dont use multiline comments anymore as it is easy to select code and press ctrl+/
